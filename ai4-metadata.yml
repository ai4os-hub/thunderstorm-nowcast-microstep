title: Thunderstorm nowcast (MicroStep-MIS)
summary: Thunderstorm nowcast based on radar data (for agrometeorology)
description: |-
  ai4eosc_thunder_nowcast_ml is an application using the DEEPaaS API.

#**Training the deep learning model(s)**
  In project is needed software preprocessed [tabular radar data](https://github.com/ai4os-hub/thunderstorm-nowcast-microstep/tree/main/data/examples) 
  for training and predict severe convective rain. The main goal is to send warning messages to farmers.

  Algorithm needs CAPPI2000 and VIL (vertical integrated liquid water) radar products for AREAs - city and its close surrounding.
  The both processes of train and predict are fully [configurable](https://github.com/ai4os-hub/thunderstorm-nowcast-microstep/tree/main/data/configs).
  You can specify Neural network architecture, forecast time, which Areas include, forecast time, etc. However, you have set same configuration for
  prediction as was set during training.
